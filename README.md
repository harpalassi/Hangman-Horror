# HANGMAN HORROR ðŸ‘»

_Hangman Horror_ is a hangman game based upon titles of cult horror films. The game was created with JavaScript, HTML5, Bootstrap, and CSS3. I incorporated edge-cases such as the user only being able to enter numbers and letters and disabling or enabling all keys at certain times. I also added CSS animations across various components.

## Functionality

The user will try to guess the word displayed by underscores. They will have 5 guesses and each incorrect guess will be displayed. After the user wins or loses, the game will automatically select a new word. The number of wins and losses are tallied.
